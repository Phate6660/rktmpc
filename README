### rktmpc ###

An MPC-type program (as in a CLI for MPD).
Not meant to be any sort of serious project.
Mostly an example for https://github.com/Phate6660/racket-mpdclient
Note: The above lib must be installed for this work, for... obvious reasons.

$ racket main.rkt --help
rktmpc [ <option> ... ]
 where <option> is one of
  -p, --play : Play MPD.
  -P, --pause : Pause MPD.
  -s <cmd>, --seek <cmd> : Controls various MPD playback functions.
  --help, -h : Show this help
  -- : Do not treat any remaining argument as a switch (at this level)
 Multiple single-letter switches can be combined after one `-'; for
  example: `-h-' is the same as `-h --'

<cmd> =
- next (for skipping to next song)
- prev (for going back to the song before)
